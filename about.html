          I am Christopher Jan Llanes Cayabyab, graduated from National University Laguna - Asia Pacific College Program Extension
          with the course of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. At first I had no interest in programming, but as I tried 
          learning and exploring different technologies, I discovered my passion for solving problems and building solutions through code. 
          My journey during Internship has taught me the value of persistence, creativity, and continuous learning in the ever-evolving 
          world of technology.
